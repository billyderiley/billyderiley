### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm currently working on âš¡
Web2Music -  A tool for music collectors, DJs, and listeners, Web2Music scrapes metadata from various music and media streaming platforms and marketplaces (currently only supports Discogs, Spotify, Youtube). The end result is an App that can produce playlists of music tracks, either on Youtube or Spotify, and the metadata that is found on the web is used to filter in or filter out certain tracks by genre, year, style, format of publish etc.

âš¡ I have worked on âš¡
Arraydio - A tool for music collectors to organise music by sounds, styles, genres, using Audio deep learning. The script scans a users iTunes music library, giving songs with labels according to their playlist membership. After performing audio feature engineering (Zero-crossing rate, MFCC, Spectral Centroid), in the process of audio deep learning in TorchAudio, the scipt can then rank unseen songs on their likelihood of membership in a given playlist.

SplitThat - An application designed to ease the process of splitting the cost of a service between a group of individuals. This was my final submission of coursework for the module COMP0015 'Intro to Programming in Java', as part of my BSc Neuroscience at UCL. SplitThat can hadnle mutiple users, allow for any type of bill to be split such as table bills, rental, or holiday expenses. It uses a fair-voting algorithm - essentially users enter what they believe they should pay, and outputs a table of what SplitThat thinks each user should pay,  after calculating voting weights.

âš¡ I'm looking to collaborate âš¡
Love music and AI as much as I do? I'm keen to work on anyone's audio ML project in any capacity whether thats providing a helping hand in code (Python, Java, SQL, C++), or acting as a test user in your project to provide feedback. Send a message!
